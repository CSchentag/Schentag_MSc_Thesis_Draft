\section{Flight Results}
Discuss overall how the flight went.

\section{Mechanical Results}
Discuss what happened mechanically, and how it compared to what was expected in the design.

\section{Flight Temperature Model}
Discuss creating a full model of an atmospheric flight instrument.

\subsection{Ascent}
Creating a model for the ascent

\subsection{Float}
Creating a model the float part of the flight

\subsection{Sunlight}
Maybe create a model of the instrument while its in sunlight, if time/if necessary.
